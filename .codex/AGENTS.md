For this entire task, you must log every change you make:

- Use a markdown file named `codex-log.md` in the project root.
- After each edit, append:
  - A brief description of the change,
  - The filenames you modified,
  - The full updated code block(s) you changed.

Do not make any code changes without also updating `codex-log.md`.
